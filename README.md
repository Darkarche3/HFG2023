# Project Description
Global Connect is a one-stop project crowdsourcing repository, enabling registered companies to share social initaitives that they are organising and garner partners and participants.  Projects are displayed in a list format, organised by categories. Signing up is fast and straightforward, and participants can easily reach out to organisers via email to enquire more about specific projects of interest. Drawing together a wide variety of companies, each is able to contribute resources and skills from their field of expertise to help "solve each other's problems" and execute successful projects that affect real change to their target beneficiaries.

Our key feature is the collaborations page, where a visitor can see at a glance all ongoing partnerships between any two parties. This is useful in enabling companies to keep track of all ongoing partnerships, as well as identify companies with whom they may wish to extend an invitation to work together! Visitors can also view individual profile pages to learn more about a company's projects and areas of business.
